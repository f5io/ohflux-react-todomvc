# Keflux - Kefir + Flux in Reflux Style

- To install run `npm install`.
- Run with `npm start`.

The `core` file contains a potential library based on Reflux, however using Kefir to make both Actions and Stores observables. A developer would most likely only create the files outside of this `core` directory.

## Roadmap

- ~~Clean up stuff.~~
- ~~Refactor `createStore`.~~
- ~~Asynchronous actions.~~
- Move over to transducers or curried, composed functions.
- Extract lib.
- Document.
